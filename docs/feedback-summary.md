# Summary of Recent Feedback

## Module 3 Checkpoint 3

Your sequence of figures was graded with the spirit of trying to get rapid feedback returned to you. We have picked out some of the highest order concerns we had with your submission. Each concern was flagged with only a small point deduction, even concerns that may be significant. Before coming to office hours or requesting a re-grade, we ask that you please read the feedback carefully and try to surmise how it is applicable to your sequence of figures. Please carefully re-read [Module 1 Week 4](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-1/week4){:target="_blank"} and [Module 2 Week 4](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-2/week4){:target="_blank"}. That way you can come to office hours with specific questions. We are happy to answer specific questions, but we will not have time in office hours this week to provide a review of your poster before you submit.

## Module 2 Deliverable

Your submission was graded on the overall cohesion and coherence of your sequence of figures, the mechanics of your individual figures, and the accuracy/correctness of your analysis. 

The mechanics of your individual figures was evaluated based on the criteria from [Module 1 Week 4](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-1/week4){:target="_blank"}. The accuracy of your result was assessed based on how reasonable your values and error bars were, and if they were unreasonable, how severe were the issues. The overall cohesion of your figure sequence was evaluated based on the criteria described in [Module 2 Week 4](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-2/week4){:target="_blank"}. Specific items we deducted points from in the category of cohesion are listed below.

### Global cohesiveness

#### Image(s) of how the data was collected:
+ No marker to indicate sphere or marked in a way that completely obscures the sphere 
+ Only a single panel (one point in time for the falling sphere) was shown
+ Sequence of panels shown but zoomed in so it is hard to work out what is going on (can’t see beaker). 
+ View too zoomed out to make out bead & single panel 
+ Does not include any sort of figure showing the ball dropping in solution 

#### Demonstration of how terminal velocity was extracted from the figure
+ Does not include a plot of displacement v.s. t for determining terminal velocity
+ No indication of region of data from which v was determined 
+ Region indicated but not in a clear way (e.g all points highlighted instead of end points, or text does not indicated what highlighted points are or isn’t clear) 
+ Caption of figure 1 is unfocused 
+ Displacement v.s. Time graph doesn’t show enough data points to see the expected clear linear trend 
+ Caption includes misleading claims or statements 

#### Figure 2
+ Horizontal bars indicating mean value and error bars not shown on plot 
+ Either mean value or error bars not show on plot 
+ Mean value not reported in caption 
+ Uncertainty in mean value not reported in caption 
+ Mean value and uncertainty not reported in caption 
+ Mean value and uncertainty not reported in caption or shown on plot 
+ Description of why larger spheres were not used for determining velocity in caption is unclear or not concise 
+ No explanation of why larger spheres are excluded from determination of viscosity
+ Exclusion of larger spheres not mentioned 
+ Data from 6mm bead not included 
+ Data from both 4.5mm and 6mm beads not included 
+ Both effects (data from 4.5/6mm beads not included) and their exclusion not mentioned 
+ Caption includes unjustified or misleading claims (e.g. viscosity increases with sphere size, or calculated viscosity increases quadratically)  
+ Error bars not included with data  [This is only a small deduction because it is assumed that it will also be deducted elsewhere but it is still part of the global story too.]
+ Unconventional symbols are used in the caption/description without definition in a way that is likely to confuse the reader, e.g. V for viscosity  [This is only a small deduction because it is assumed that it will also be deducted elsewhere but it is still part of the global story too.]
+ Caption of figure 2 is unfocused
