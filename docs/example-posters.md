# Example Posters

Here are some example research posters that HMC physics students have made.

| Poster Link | Notes
-------------| ------------
[Example 1 (Prof. Gerbode)](posters/Gerbode.pdf){:target="_blank"} | Although not labeled "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", the information flows predominantly along those lines. |

[Example 2 (Prof. Lynn)](posters/Lynn.png){:target="_blank"} | Follows our Ph50 standard sections. Poster is focused on one major result in Fig. 2, which is rich with information. |

[Example 3 (Prof. Arlett)](posters/Arlett.pdf){:target="_blank"} | Includes a "Methods" section, and the results are labeled according to their content. |

[Example 4 (Prof. Shuve)](posters/Shuve.pdf){:target="_blank"} | Figure captions are short, with more information in the main text of the poster. |

[Example 5 (Prof. Ilton)](posters/Ilton.pdf){:target="_blank"} | This poster contains little accompanying text and was presented verbally at a conference. This style is not appropriate for Ph50 because you will not be presenting this poster verbally.
